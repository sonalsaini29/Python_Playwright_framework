# Python_Playwright_framework
Playwright is a powerful open-source framework developed by Microsoft for automating web browsers. It supports multiple browsers and provides a unified API for automating browser interactions. With Playwright, you can write scripts in various languages, including Python and Java, which makes it a versatile choice for web automation and testing.
# Key Features
Multi-Browser Support: Playwright can automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers with a single API.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Automatic Waiting: Automatically waits for elements to be ready before performing actions.
Network Control: Allows request interception and response mocking.
Headless and Headed Modes: Supports both headless and headed execution.
Rich API: Provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with web pages.
# Installation and Setup
**Python**
**Step 1:** Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed. You can download Python from the official website. Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation.

**Step 2:** Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

<bash>
    mkdir playwright-python-demo
    
    cd playwright-python-demo
    
    python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

<bash>

    
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
On macOS/Linux:

<bash>

    
    source venv/bin/activate

**Step 3**: Install Playwright
Use pip to install Playwright and the browser binaries:

<bash>

    pip install playwright
    
    python -m playwright install
    
This installs Playwright and downloads the necessary browser binaries.

**Step 4**: Write a Test Script
Create a file named test_example.py and add a simple test:

python

    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_example():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('https://example.com')
        assert page.title() == 'Example Domain'
        browser.close()

test_example()

**Step 5**: Run the Test
Run your test script using Python:

<bash>

    python test_example.py
  
This will open a browser, navigate to the example.com website, and verify the page title.
